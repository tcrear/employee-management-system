U of MN Bootcamp Homework #12

## Description
The motivation of the project was to create an interface that allows non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. The assignment is built with a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.
